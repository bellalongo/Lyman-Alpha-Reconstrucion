### Description:
The goal of the PINN model is to predict the flux and absorption coefficient to satisfy the Radiative Transfer Equation below:

∂I/∂x = -α(x) * I(x) where I(x) = F(x) / (c * λ)

with I(x) being the intensity, F(x) being the flux, c being the speed of light in Angstroms/s, and λ being the wavelength of the Lyman alpha line in Angstroms
